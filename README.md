# picpalette

Drop an image and get a bunch of colors!

*picpalette* is a really simple and straight-forward web app that let's you drop the image URL or upload an image to get the dominant color and palette.

## The idea

This idea came up after seeing [lokesh](/lokesh)'s [**Color Thief**](/lokesh/color-thief). I thought making a simpler website version for updated graphics.
